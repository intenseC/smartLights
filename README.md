Smart Home Approach â€” Automated Lights

The funniest part in this project was to measure ambient light
with a simple led using algorithm developed by Mitsubishi guys
(Very Low-Cost Sensing and CommunicationUsing Bidirectional LEDs)
The ADC values were very stable to my surprise, hence measuring
is quite accurate.
